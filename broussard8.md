1. One interesting thing was that the people leading autonomous driving in 2007 were college teams that were competing in competitions held by the government.
2. I feel like the author is exaggerating her reaction to the prototype autonomous car. She knew it was a work in progress before getting in and it was her decision to get in no one forced her. They never risked her life either, the test was done in an empty lot and they had an emergency stop ready in case something unintentional occurred. Her saying the researchers were reckless with her life is dramatic. She made the decision to get in the car and when the car started acting out they stopped it. I feel like this was all something she should have expected before consenting to get into the car.
3. The author talks about the dangers of autonomous driving but then she does something pretty hypocritical. She talks about her own dangerous driving and how she loved it. She floored it not once but twice. This was not a mistake on her part this was intentional and reckless. I keep getting the feeling from the author that she has strong stances on many issues but then does not apply the stances to herself. For example, the constant generalizations about programmers but then she argues against other peoples generalizations about women. If you disagree with people apply generalizations to women you should not turn around and apply generalizations to programmers. This behavior is incredibly obnoxious.
