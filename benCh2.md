1. I think having a system that attempts to predict the risk of someone committing a crime in the future are wrong from the get go. Our justice system is based off the idea of innocent until proven guilty but a system like this would directly conflict with that. It is trying to prove people are guilty before they even do anything.
2. The author brings up an interesting point about glitches. They can be used to gain knowledge about the system that would other wise not be seen. By studying glitches we are able to see how a system was designed and with what intentions based on what the glitch exactly is. For google maps it was pronouncing the X in Malcom X as a roman numeral which highlights the shortsightedness of the developers when implementing the roman numeral interpreter.
3. The author talks about how architecture itself can be used to express social hierarchies. For example the bridge made by Robert Moses that was too short to allow buses through which effectively made the bridge only useable by people who owned their own personal car. This cut off people, specifically Black people, in the city from travelling outside to the suburbs and beaches.
