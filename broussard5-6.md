1. The standardized test are setup so that to do well on them you must have the textbooks that the publishers of the test publish because all the information on the test is modified versions of common knowledge. The school system itself is practically being held hostage by these publishers and when you try to apply an AI or computer program to this it will pick up on this pattern. Most of the time standardized test are used to determine where money is allocated, and with poorer districts not being able to afford these textbooks they will continue to score poorly and never get the funding they need.

2. Data is not perfect. It has plenty of flaws and the people responsible for entering most data is humans and we make mistakes all the time so to not expect an error to occur while entering in data would be ridiculous. Data is full of human mistakes so it should not be treated as some absolute truth.

3. The author makes a statement that really bothered me. On page 79 she discusses that because neither Stephen Wolfram or Marvin Minsky knew how to take care of houseplants and Marvin said to ask his wife, that this showed how women were expected to know how to take care of growing things whereas men weren't. She then says that this suggest a learned helplessness in both these scientist. There are so many other possible answers for this situation. It is possible that gardening is Marvin’s wife’s hobby and so she would have the knowledge of how to take care of houseplants. It is also stated that these plants are not even Marvin’s but his daughter’s plants so why would he know how to take care of her plants. The author states that Stephen could have contacted the local hardware store for help but instead contacted Minsky. Again this can very simply be explained because Stephen probably contacted Marvin since it involved his daughter. I think this is such a pathetic and forced argument in a situation where it does not pertain at all. If this is how the author plans to make the rest of their arguments then I am not looking forward to reading this book.
