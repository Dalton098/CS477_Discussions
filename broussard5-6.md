1. The standardized test are setup so that to do well on them you must have the textbooks that the publishers of the test publish because all the information on the test is modified versions of common knowledge. The school system itself is practically being held hostage by these publishers and when you try to apply an AI or computer program to this it will pick up on this pattern. Most of the time standardized test are used to determine where money is allocated, and with poorer districts not being able to afford these textbooks they will continue to score poorly and never get the funding they need.
2. Data is not perfect. It has plenty of flaws and the people responsible for entering most data is humans and we make mistakes all the time so to not expect an error to occur while entering in data would be ridiculous. Data is full of human mistakes.
3. Technology will not solve every problem. When talking about textbooks, the author discusses the option of giving students e-readers or laptops and how many other problems result from this solution. Also, if the people are not properly taught how to use this technology to their benefit it results in it being used for purposes other than education.
4. Previous generations were plagued with fixating on only creating advancements instead of worry about the ethics of what they were creating and regulations that should be applied to the technology. They never stopped to consider what might happen because of their actions and only focused on creating new cutting edge technology.
