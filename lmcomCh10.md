1. This reading focused on Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and went show it was most likely a pseudoscience. NLP claims that it can help or cure a wide sweeping amount of mental issues such as improve communication, cure phobuas, treat depression, etc. There is a lack of agreement between those that teach NLP so it is difficult to say exactly what it is. NLP ideas were popularized in the 1980s but since then most research has shown NLP has no impact. It was interesting to read this about mental health practices because that has been a big focus of my generation. It is concerning to hear a form of treatment in the past is now seen as pseudoscience but that seems to be the norm with how technology and education builds on top of itself.
2. I believe the author because they used the work of a researcher who conducted a literary analysis on NLP experiments and papers.
