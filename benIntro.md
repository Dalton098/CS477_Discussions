1. I thought it was pretty funny to hear that the California gang database had babies less than 1 in it. It is such an absurd scenario and could have easily been spotted if they looked at the database at all. How could someone not have noticed that this was a serious error affecting peopleâ€™s lives?
2. Many technologies have developed some form of racial bias. They might not be designed inherently to be this way but when using data the system will pick up on the biases that are present in the data and then express those biases  itself. This highlights how important it is to make sure the data that you are using is properly checked for possibly biases that are not easily noticed at first look.
3. The one quote used in the book said that too many people are listening to programmers and I agree with that statement. Computer scientist are people that focused on study computers and writing programs, they did not major in political science or psychology but are being used in situations where experts from those fields should be used and listened to because they might offer a warning about some of the technology created. Ethical questions and the societal consequences of a given system should be answered by a multitude of experts and not decided only by programmers.
