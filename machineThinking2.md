One argument brought up that I think makes a very good point against machine being able to think is that machine do not know what to do in an unforeseen situation. For example if a human were to encounter a broken traffic light that was displaying both green and red they would still be able to make a decision in this situation but a machine would not know what to do. It could stop cause it is red but it could also go because it has a green light. In this case the human is able to adapt to the scenario even if they have never seen it before where as a machine would have to have some form of data about this situation beforehand to be able to handle it. In this case, the human is able to be creative and come up with a new solution but the same can not be said for the machine.
