1. The author talks a lot of about buzzwords used for new innovations in technology and even talks about how the show “Silicon Valley” spoofed this phenomenon. I think this buzzword craze has had a negative impact on the overall industry because all it does it make it even harder to understand the technology and software that is being used by gating it behind obscure definitions. It was surprising to hear that it was a common believe in the past that people of different races had different lung capacity and that it was so normal to think this way that it was implemented into medical equipment. One of the last things the author talks about is how people that are not targeted by racist programs/software can sleep soundly knowing that it is being used for the greater good is a very real statement. People tend to be ignorant about things that do not impact them, myself included, I was not aware of how racially biased some technology was/is.
2. I started to lose the video when he was discussing policy gradient. It sounds like it is similar to a confidence rating where the highest probability is the action that should be taken. I feel like I do not understand this well enough and if possible could we go more in-depth on this in class.
