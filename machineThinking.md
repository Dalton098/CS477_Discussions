## Can Machines Think?

##### Dalton Rothenberger

1. I think the question of Can Machines Think comes down to what you really define as thinking. In this paper Turing describes it as being able to imitate a human. At this moment we have machines that are capable of imitating humans at various task but not at everything man can do. For instance, Alpha Go was able to imitate humans ability to play go and even perform better than humans at the game. However this same machine is not capable of accomplishing everything a human can do. I would say machines cannot think in the way humans do but they are capable of accomplishing task that require thought. They are capable of doing these task by following the instructions given to them but they do not come up with the instructions themselves.
