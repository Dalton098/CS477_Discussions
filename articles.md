1. For the first article this new early detection program just sounds like a mess already. One of the issues the system has to deal with is determining intent/determine mental illness which even humans do incorrectly all the time. I feel like this increased surveillance and push for backdoors is a bit ridiculous and shows how out of touch these people are. Instead of apply surveillance to everyone to try to determine mental illness, they could try to raise more awareness on the issue and even fund better programs to help deal with mental illness. This system is just going to end up imprisoning people for their thoughts and as seen from all the past examples prison does not really work as a deterrent for future crime and instead we should be focused on assistance programs.
2. In high school my class did edge detection as one of our projects and it is interesting to see that CNNs uses a similar set of fundamental tools as edge detection. Our approach was algorithmic but we still used kernels and padding when processing the image. It is interesting to see that the CNN seem to function in a trickle down manner where the goal of each layer is to remove some dimensions from the image. One question I still have is how does the CNN actually go about identify an image? Like how exactly does it determine that it is more likely to be one classification over other or even how does it compare the classification to the image itself?
