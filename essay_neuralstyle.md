## Style Transfer and Essay Grading

##### Dalton Rothenberger



1. I thought the first article was interesting. I think using AI to grade an essay is an interesting concept but at the current state of AI I think it is not a great application. The AI used to grade essays is not actually learning the rubric but it is learning how other people used the rubric while grading and then trying to mimic their grading. I do not think the AI should be considered as a grader of the paper but rather as just an assistance tool for graders to make sure that their grade matches up with what might be considered an “excepted score” from the AI. It was also interesting to hear the author use the text generation AI as a assistance tool when writing his novel and I believe that is a good use of AI. Using it as a way to assist rather than as the person/thing that gets to decide everything.
2. The concept of Neural Style Transfer looks very interesting. You are able to copy the style of an artist and apply it to other images to get a rendition of it in that artist’s style. The author started to lose me when they were throwing about equations about the loss functions. How exactly are these loss functions derived? Also one minor thing, why does this author not put spaces after his periods it bothers me a surprising amount?
