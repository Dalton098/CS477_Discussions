The author makes another one of her wonderful broad sweeping claims with little evidence my favorite. On page 89 she says “Although computer scientist and mathematicians tend to be talented at computer science and math, as a group they tend not to be sensitive to the nuances of language”. I will admit right not I am horrible at English classes and they are not my strong suit but this is such a wide sweeping claim. There is literally a field in computer science called computational linguistics which focuses on studying the nuances of language. Her false claims annoy me and I am surprised this book got published with this many of them.

On page 104, the author states “As a journalist, I don’t get to make anything up. I need to fact-check each line and justify it for a fact-checker or an editor or my audience–but in machine learning people often make stuff up when it’s convenient”. The irony in this great considering some of the author’s prior claims. If what the author is saying here is true, then I don’t know what happened when they fact checked this book.

One thing the author pointed out that was interesting was that all machine learning is done on data that is available. They are built of the information at hand but that information my not be complete or it might even be missing a key component. For example with the Titanic, the two different officers played a huge part in who survived and who didn't but this is not mentioned anywhere in the data.
