1. The author mentions how people who were blind from birth were asked about their experiences with race. They said that they were able to understand racial hierarchies and distinctions even without sight. I found this very interesting that race is so embedded in society that it can be determined even without needing to physically see the person. They were able to perceive race based off of every sense but sight. It was interesting to see code switching brought up because I had learned about this during my sociology class and it was interesting to see that people were designing software with code switching in mind. They were aiding children in being able to learn code switching by using virtual avatars.
2. It looks like things for this could be broken relatively easily. We will need to build a test course and props for it on top of doing all the programming/assembling for the car. We could try for something like 1 part of the guide each week as a good schedule.
