1. It was interesting to see that the photography industry did not react to something like black parents complaining that the photo of their kid in the year book was blurry or underexposed but reacted to companies that produced chocolate or something involving wood complained. 
2. I had no idea about Polaroid profiting off of apartheid by selling cameras and identification units in South Africa. I am glad to hear people protested about it but what is more concerning is that the company did it at all.
3. The discussion of positive and negative eugenic was quite disturbing to read about. This is clearly a problem no matter how it could ever be implemented. By picking one population as being desirable and the other undesirable you are inherently going to cause some form or racism/ageism/classism. I was also surprised to see that eugenics was actually supported by the Supreme Court at one point (I hope the stance has been changed since). I understand the goal of the concept but I do not think anyone could possibly accomplish this without some misdoings.
